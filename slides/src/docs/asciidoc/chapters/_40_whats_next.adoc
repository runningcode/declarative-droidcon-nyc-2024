A peak into the future

=== What's next? [.small]#- AGP support#
image::gradle/bg-4.png[background,size=cover]

* Working with Android to get AGP into DCL
* Simple existing DSLs will "just work"
* Some new DSLs will be added to support DCL
** Named domain object containers
** Enums

=== What's next? [.small]#- Composability#
image::gradle/bg-4.png[background,size=cover]

* Composability and extensibility very important
** There is a small number of base software types
** Additional, optional features can be "mixed-in" to a software type
* e.g., `androidApplication` does not need Compose or Hilt built-in
** Enabling compose applies the appropriate plugin and adds to the software type
** Defaults for Compose/Hilt can be defined and reused across software types

=== What's next? [.small]#- Migrations#
image::gradle/bg-4.png[background,size=cover]

* You can mix imperative and declarative in a build
* Software-types will be usable from imperative DSLs
* You can define defaults in settings and apply them in DCL/non-DCL files
* Gradle imperative DSLs don't go away
* Syntax overlap between DCL and KTS files make it easier to prepare
* Using convention plugins as software types will prepare for migration

Open questions:

* When will ecosystem plugins be ready/have migrated?
* How will plugin authors adapt/migrate?
** Same programming/annotation model as project extensions/tasks
** Possibility to reuse existing project extensions

=== What's next? [.small]#- Other#
image::gradle/bg-4.png[background, size=cover]

* Our IDE team is exploring
** LSP language server & BSP build server
** plugins for both Eclipse/Buildship and Visual Studio Code
* `gradle init` will soon support generating example builds using DCL

=== What's next? [.small]#- Speculative Roadmap#

* First EAP released in July
* Second EAP (October)
** AGP integration 
** Addressing collected feedback
** Further feedback from the community

* 2024 EOY
** More EAPs 
** More features
** Guidance from the community
