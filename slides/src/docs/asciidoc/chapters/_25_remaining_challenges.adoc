* Build language can be hard for non-expert Gradle users to understand.
* Little/no consistency between ecosystems and even projects in the same ecosystem.
* No enforcement mechanism to keep build files simple and declarative
* Arbitrary code in build scripts limit what tools can do

=== Remaining challenges [.small]#- Cross pollination üêù#

* We work closely together, share progress and results
* Attempts to address some of the remaining challenges
* Main differences
** Amper uses YAML for configuration
** Amper targets Kotlin Multiplatform only
