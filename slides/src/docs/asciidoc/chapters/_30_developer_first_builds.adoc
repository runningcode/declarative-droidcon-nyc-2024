=== Developer-first builds [.small]#- Teams#
image::gradle/bg-7.png[background,size=cover]

We work on this together 🤝

* Multiple teams at Gradle (DSL, Software, IDE)
* Android Studio team at Google
* Multiple teams at JetBrains

=== Developer-first builds [.small]#- Cross pollination 🐝#

link:https://github.com/JetBrains/amper[Amper] - an experiment by JetBrains with similar goals

* Amper uses YAML for configuration
* Amper focuses on Kotlin Multiplatform 
* Amper works in JetBrains IDEs

We're in touch with the Amper team too.

=== Developer-first builds [.small]#- Users#
image::gradle/bg-7.png[background,size=cover]

* Software Developers - Majority in most teams
** [.small]#Improve software by shipping features, fixing bugs ...#
* Build Engineers - Frequent in larger teams
** [.small]#Maintain the build, make developers productive#
* 🎩 ↔ 🧢 - Frequent in smaller teams
** [.small]#Who's the Gradle expert?#

[.notes]

Who are we talking about?

=== Developer-first builds [.small]#- Definitions#
image::gradle/bg-7.png[background,size=cover]

* Software Definition
** _What_ needs to be built
** Kind of software, languages, target platforms
** Dependencies, toolchains, quality checks etc...
* Build Logic
** _How_ the software will be built
** Adds new capabilities, integrate tools
** Supplies convention to the software definition

[.notes]
--
This is how we think about the separation.
Software developers work in a software definition.
Build engineers create build logic to make the software definition do something.

=== Developer-first builds [.small]#- Mission statement# 
image::gradle/bg-7.png[background,size=cover]

Gradle Build Tool is an open-source build system that automates the process of building software of any type, size, or complexity in a fast and reliable manner. 

What sets Gradle Build Tool apart is its **elegant and extensible declarative build language that enables expressing any build in a clear and understandable way**.

> Elegant and extensible declarative build language that allows developers to describe any kind of software in a clear and understandable way.

Current Gradle is

* Extensible ✅
* Declarative 🤔
* Clear and understandable 😕

[.notes]
--
We're extensible, but we still aspire to be declarative, clear and understandable.

=== Developer-first builds [.small]#- Key principles#
image::gradle/bg-7.png[background,size=cover]

* Improved ease of use for regular software developers
* Sustained flexibility for build engineers and advanced users
* Excellent IDE integration for everyone

[.notes]
--
We want to help software developers.
we want to keep the flexibility that people expect from Gradle.
We want tooling to be just as good/better.

=== Developer-first builds [.small]#- Disclaimers#
image::gradle/bg-7.png[background,size=cover]

* These are _experiments_ and require bleeding edge/nightly builds. 
* IDE features require special Android Studio nightly builds.
* Some IDE-like features are demonstrated outside the IDE. 
* Prototypes are changing all the time and are not ready for production use.

=== Developer-first builds [.small]#- Experiments#
image::gradle/bg-7.png[background,size=cover]

* Software types
* Declarative Configuration Language with excellent tooling
