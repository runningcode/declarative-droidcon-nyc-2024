=== Developer-first builds [.small]#- Declarative Configuration Language#

* New extension `.gradle.dcl`
* Fully declarative - no loops, conditionals or functions
* Limited subset of Kotlin
** `.gradle.dcl` look like well-written `.gradle.kts` file
** `.gradle.dcl` does not rely on Kotlin compiler 
** DCL is a configuration language, not a programming language

Reusing Kotlin leaves open the opportunity to converge 
* on strict mode for Kotlin DSL
* two languages, but shared tooling

This is to be taken with a grain of salt because while we will make things slower by adding features and correctness, we have not optimized yet, and we know we can make things faster.

This gives us a baseline and will help manage the Declarative DSL performance characteristics as we evolve the implementation.
