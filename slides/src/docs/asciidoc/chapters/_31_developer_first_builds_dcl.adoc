=== Developer-first builds [.small]#- Declarative Configuration Language#
image::gradle/bg-7.png[background,size=cover]

* `.gradle.dcl`
* Fully declarative - no loops, conditionals or functions
* Limited subset of Kotlin
** Does not rely on Kotlin compiler
** `.gradle.dcl` look like well-written `.gradle.kts` files
** Configuration language, not a programming language, parsed by Gradle

=== Developer-first builds [.small]#- Performance#

[.small]
`./gradlew assemble`

This is to be taken with a grain of salt because while we will make things slower by adding features and correctness, we have not optimized yet, and we know we can make things faster.

This gives us a baseline and will help manage the Declarative DSL performance characteristics as we evolve the implementation.

=== Developer-first builds [.small]#- Example#
image::gradle/bg-7.png[background,size=cover]

`build.gradle.dcl`
```kotlin
<1>

androidApplication { <2>
    namespace = "org.example.app" <3>

    dependencies { <4>
        implementation("org.apache.commons:commons-text:1.11.0") <5>
        implementation(project(":utilities"))
    }
}
```
<1> Notice that there are no plugins.
<2> This is the type of software this project will produce.
<3> Configuring a simple property.
<4> Configuring a nested block.
<5> Type-safe custom dependencies block.

=== Developer-first builds [.small]#- DCL vs KTS#

Our intention is to make software types available to KTS, so you can write everything like a DCL while still having access to more powerful things. 

This helps with migration.
