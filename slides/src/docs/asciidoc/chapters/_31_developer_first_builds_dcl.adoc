=== Developer-first builds [.small]#- Declarative Configuration Language#
image::gradle/bg-11.png[background,size=cover]

* `.gradle.dcl`
* Fully declarative - no loops, conditionals or functions
* Limited subset of Kotlin
** Does not rely on Kotlin compiler
** `.gradle.dcl` look like well-written `.gradle.kts` files
** Parsed outside the Gradle runtime

`./gradlew assemble`

This is to be taken with a grain of salt because while we will make things slower by adding features and correctness, we have not optimized yet, and we know we can make things faster.
This gives us a baseline and will help manage the Declarative DSL performance characteristics as we evolve the implementation.
